//! ClearCodec (MS-RDPEGFX 2.2.4.1 for the bitstream, 3.3.8.1.3 for the decode
//! rules).
//!
//! `RDPGFX_CODECID_CLEARCODEC` (0x0008). Lossless and non wavelet, built for
//! the mixed content RemoteFX handles badly: window chrome, text, flat fills
//! with a photograph in the middle. One bitmap decomposes into three layers
//! composited in a fixed order, with a glyph cache in front of the whole
//! thing.
//!
//! ## Compositing order
//!
//! Residual first, because it fills the whole bitmap. Then bands, which
//! overwrite. Then the subcodec rectangles, which overwrite again
//! (MS-RDPEGFX 3.3.8.1.3). A layer that is absent contributes nothing and
//! does not clear what came before, which is why a zero `residualByteCount`
//! is ordinary rather than an error.
//!
//! ## Three caches, and why a miss is not fatal
//!
//! Every cache in this codec is exact: the server tracks what it believes we
//! hold and sends an index rather than the pixels. If we ever miss a bitmap,
//! every later hit reads the wrong entry. So [`ClearDecoder`] keeps an
//! expected sequence number and a mismatch is
//! [`DecodeError::StateLost`], which `rdp-core` handles by clearing all
//! ClearCodec state, logging once, and carrying on. Carrying on is right
//! rather than failing the session, because the server repaints the affected
//! region on its next full frame and a stale glyph shows for at most one
//! frame (PRDRDP/04 §4.8.1).
//!
//! A v1 stream starts its sequence at zero on the first bitmap of a channel
//! and a v2 stream may start anywhere, because the sequence survives a
//! `RESET_GRAPHICS`. So any value is accepted as the first sequence number on
//! a channel and the increment is enforced only from the second bitmap
//! onward. That is one line and it is the difference between working against
//! Windows Server 2012 R2 and not.
//!
//! ## Two fields this lane could not pin, stated plainly
//!
//! PRDRDP/04 §4.8 names exactly two fields that have to be read out of the
//! specification rather than assumed, and MS-RDPEGFX §4's ClearCodec example
//! was not available to this lane. Both are implemented from reasoning that
//! is written out at the point of use, both are isolated in one function so a
//! vector corrects them in one place, and neither can overrun a buffer
//! whichever way it turns out:
//!
//! * The VBar header split, in [`vbar_header`]. PRDRDP/04 §4.8.3's own table
//!   contradicts its own cache sizes, and the cache sizes win. See that
//!   function.
//! * The RLEX segment byte, in [`rlex_code`]. See that function.
