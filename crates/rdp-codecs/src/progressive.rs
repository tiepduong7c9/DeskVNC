//! Progressive RemoteFX (MS-RDPEGFX 2.2.4.2, decode rules 3.3.7).
//!
//! `RDPGFX_CODECID_CAPROGRESSIVE` (0x0009). A second, larger RemoteFX decoder
//! with its own persistent tile store: the first pass carries a coarse tile
//! and later passes refine it in place, so a tile's coefficients survive
//! between frames and the store is the codec's whole memory budget
//! ([`state`], PRDRDP/04 §4.9.4).
//!
//! ## Why this is compiled by default
//!
//! It used to be behind an off by default cargo feature, on the argument that
//! a phase 1 binary does not need it and the fuzzer would have to cover it
//! anyway. `docs/RDP_SPEC_NOTES.md` §1.6 overtook that argument. Progressive
//! is available from EGFX capability version 8, which is what we advertise,
//! and nothing declines it: `RDPGFX_CAPS_FLAG_AVC_DISABLED` exists only from
//! version 10 and there is no progressive equivalent at any version. So a
//! server may legitimately send this codec id and, without a decoder, the
//! session stops with a named refusal. A feature that is off cannot save a
//! session. The `progressive` feature still exists, so
//! `--no-default-features` gives back a binary without it, but it is on.
//!
//! ## What is shared with `remotefx` and what is not
//!
//! Shared, as calls rather than copies: the RLGR1 entropy decode
//! ([`crate::remotefx::rlgr::decode`]) and its bit reader, the run mode
//! adaptation constants, `RFX_COMPONENT_CODEC_QUANT` parsing
//! ([`crate::remotefx::quant::parse_quant`]), the LL3 differential decode and
//! the inverse quantization in the plain layout, the **whole** inverse
//! wavelet in the plain layout ([`crate::remotefx::dwt::inverse_2d`]), the
//! clip region and rectangle arithmetic, the tile blit, the colour transform
//! ([`crate::remotefx::ycbcr`]) and the scratch buffers
//! ([`crate::remotefx::RfxScratch`], which is the same four buffers).
//!
//! Not shared, because they are genuinely different:
//!
//! * The block set. Progressive reuses the `0xCCCx` numbers with **different
//!   meanings**: `0xCCC1` is `WBT_FRAME_BEGIN` here and `WBT_CODEC_VERSIONS`
//!   in MS-RDPRFX, `0xCCC4` is `WBT_REGION` here and `WBT_FRAME_BEGIN` there.
//!   Reading the two documents side by side is a trap and it is why this
//!   walk is a separate function rather than a mode flag on the RemoteFX one.
//! * The subband layout, when `RFX_DWT_REDUCE_EXTRAPOLATE` is set. Ten bands
//!   of different sizes, from a wavelet whose halves are 33 and 31 rather
//!   than 32 and 32 ([`bands`], [`dwt`]).
//! * The SRL layer, which has no RemoteFX counterpart at all ([`srl`]).
//! * The per tile state and the diff across passes ([`state`]).
//! * RLGR3. Progressive is RLGR1 only, so the `properties` word and the
//!   entropy selection of `TS_RFX_CONTEXT` have no equivalent here.
//!
//! ## Section numbering
//!
//! The stub this replaced cited MS-RDPEGFX 3.3.7 for the decode rules and
//! PRDRDP/04 §4.9 cites 3.3.8.2 for the same procedure. Both numbers appear
//! in the tree and neither could be checked against the document, so this
//! module says 3.3.7 throughout and the disagreement is recorded rather than
//! silently resolved.
