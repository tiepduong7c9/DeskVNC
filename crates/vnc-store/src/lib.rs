//! Persistence layer for DeskVNCViewer.
//!
//! - [`Store`]: SQLite-backed host profiles, groups, tags, history, settings,
//!   TOFU certificate pins, and a file-based thumbnail cache.
//! - [`CredentialStore`]: secrets in the OS keychain, with an encrypted-file
//!   fallback (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305) when no keychain is available.
//! - [`RdpSettings`]: the typed form of the `hosts.rdp_settings` blob, which
//!   the store itself never parses (PRDRDP/08 §2.4).
//! - [`SshSettings`]: the typed form of the `hosts.ssh_settings` blob, on the
//!   same terms as [`RdpSettings`].
//! - [`parse_rdp_file`]: reads a Microsoft `.rdp` file into a draft profile.
//!   It writes nothing; the draft goes to the host editor and the user saves
//!   it (PRDRDP/08 §5.4).
//!
//! No secret is ever written to the SQLite database; `hosts.has_password` is
//! only a flag. Credentials are keyed by the host profile UUID so renaming a
//! host never orphans a credential.
//!
//! All APIs are synchronous. Keychain and Argon2 calls block, callers on an
//! async runtime must wrap them in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.

// This crate parses bytes controlled by a remote peer. Memory safety here is
// enforced by the compiler rather than by review.
