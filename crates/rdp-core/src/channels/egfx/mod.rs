//! The graphics pipeline, `Microsoft::Windows::RDS::Graphics` (MS-RDPEGFX,
//! PRDRDP/04 §3).
//!
//! # The shape of one message
//!
//! A drdynvc message on this channel is an `RDP_SEGMENTED_DATA` envelope
//! holding RDP 8.0 bulk compressed bytes, and those bytes are a concatenation
//! of `RDPGFX_HEADER` commands (MS-RDPEGFX 2.2.1.5). So one message is:
//! decompress once, then walk commands until the buffer is empty. A frame is
//! `RDPGFX_START_FRAME_PDU`, some drawing, `RDPGFX_END_FRAME_PDU`, and the
//! acknowledgement we send back.
//!
//! # ZGFX, and the reason this file is careful about parse failures
//!
//! `docs/RDP_SPEC_NOTES.md` §1.1 records that the ZGFX token table in
//! `rdp_codecs::zgfx` is a reconstruction rather than a transcription: the
//! eleven match rows prove themselves arithmetically and the literal rows do
//! not. If one literal row is wrong, decompression produces a wrong byte
//! every few thousand, and a wrong byte inside an EGFX message is usually a
//! `cmdId` or a `pduLength` that does not parse.
//!
//! That note also says the reconstruction "must not go live before the vector
//! is run". This is the commit that puts it live, so the mitigation is the
//! other half of what the note asks for: a message that decompresses and then
//! fails to parse is reported as
//! [`RdpError::Protocol`] naming ZGFX and the specification note, rather than
//! as a generic PDU error. The failure mode is loud and it points at the right
//! file. See [`Egfx::commands`] and the test that pins the message.
//!
//! # Per frame allocations
//!
//! Three things are allocated once and reused for the life of the channel:
//! the 2.5 MB ZGFX history (`rdp_codecs::zgfx::HISTORY`), the decompression
//! output buffer [`Egfx::message`], and every codec scratch in
//! [`decode::Decoders`]. A `WIRE_TO_SURFACE_1` hands the decoder a slice of
//! the decompression buffer and a [`DstView`](rdp_codecs::DstView) over the
//! destination surface, so there is no per rectangle intermediate buffer
//! anywhere on the path (D9).
//!
//! What is allocated per frame is the handover: one `Vec<u8>` per rectangle
//! that reaches the shell, because `remote_core::RectPayload::Rgba` owns its
//! bytes, and the `Vec<DecodedRect>` that carries them. That is the same cost
//! the legacy bitmap path pays at
//! `crates/rdp-core/src/session/graphics.rs:205`.
