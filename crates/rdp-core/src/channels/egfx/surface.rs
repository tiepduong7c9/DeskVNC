//! EGFX surfaces: the offscreen bitmaps every graphics command draws into
//! (MS-RDPEGFX 2.2.2.9, 3.3.5.6, PRDRDP/04 §3.3).
//!
//! # Why surfaces exist at all
//!
//! A legacy bitmap update names a rectangle on the screen. An EGFX command
//! names a rectangle on a *surface*, and a separate command says where, if
//! anywhere, that surface appears on the output. That indirection is what
//! makes `RDPGFX_SURFACE_TO_CACHE` and `RDPGFX_CACHE_TO_SURFACE` worth having:
//! a window border decoded once is pasted back a hundred times without a byte
//! crossing the wire. A client that threw the surface away after drawing it
//! would have to fail every one of those commands, which on a real Windows
//! desktop is most of the traffic.
//!
//! # The storage format, and a divergence from PRDRDP/04 §3.3
//!
//! §3.3 stores a surface BGRA8888, and `remote_pixel::OutFormat::Bgra`'s own
//! comment repeats it (`crates/remote-pixel/src/dst.rs:120`). These store
//! RGBA8888 instead. The reason is the emit path: what the renderer takes is
//! `remote_core::RectPayload::Rgba`
//! (`crates/remote-core/src/events.rs:28`), so a BGRA surface would need a per
//! pixel swizzle every time a rectangle left it. Nothing is gained in
//! exchange, because every decoder in `rdp-codecs` takes the destination
//! channel order as a parameter and costs the same either way
//! ([`remote_pixel::put`] resolves it at monomorphisation). Storing RGBA makes
//! the emit a row copy.
//!
//! # The one copy, and the one that follows it
//!
//! A decoder writes each pixel of a rectangle exactly once, straight into the
//! surface, through a [`DstView`] carrying the surface's stride: that is D9's
//! zero copy invariant, and [`Surface::view`] is the only way to get one.
//! Handing a rectangle to the shell is then one contiguous `extend_from_slice`
//! per row out of the surface into the event payload
//! ([`Surface::copy_out`]), which is the same transfer the legacy bitmap path
//! makes at `crates/rdp-core/src/session/graphics.rs:205`. It is not a second
//! decode and it is not a conversion; it is the handover, and it exists
//! because `RectPayload::Rgba` owns its bytes.
