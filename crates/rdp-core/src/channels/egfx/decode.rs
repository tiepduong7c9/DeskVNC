//! Wire to surface: routing one `bitmapData` to the decoder that owns it
//! (MS-RDPEGFX 2.2.2.1, PRDRDP/04 §3.4).
//!
//! # The boundary
//!
//! `rdp-pdu` parses down to the first byte of a codec's own bitstream and
//! stops (`crates/rdp-pdu/src/vc/mod.rs:39`). Everything past that byte is
//! `rdp-codecs`'. This file is the twenty lines between them: it turns a

//!
//! # The one copy
//!
//! Every arm below hands the decoder two things: a `&[u8]` borrowed from the
//! decompressed EGFX message, and a [`DstView`] over the destination surface
//! carrying the surface's own stride. There is no rectangle sized buffer in
//! between, so the decoder's write into the surface is the only time these
//! pixels are written (D9, PRDRDP/04 §4.2).
//!
//! # Every scratch is allocated once
//!
//! [`Decoders`] is created with the channel and lives as long as it. The
//! RemoteFX coefficient scratch is 4 * 4096 * 2 bytes, ClearCodec carries a
//! glyph cache and two VBar caches, and the planar decoder carries its plane
//! buffers; all of them grow to their working size on the first frame and are
//! reused for every frame after it (PRDRDP/04 §4.1 rule two).
