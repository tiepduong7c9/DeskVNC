//! `drdynvc`, the dynamic virtual channel multiplexer (MS-RDPEDYC,
//! PRDRDP/05 §5.2).
//!
//! One static channel carries an arbitrary number of dynamic ones. The server
//! opens each by name, the client answers with a creation status, and after
//! that both sides exchange fragments tagged with the dynamic channel id.
//! This file is the multiplexer and nothing else: it owns the version
//! handshake, the open channel table and the per channel reassembly, and it
//! hands a complete message to whichever handler owns that channel.
//!
//! # What we open, and what we refuse
//!
//! Two names are answered with `STATUS_SUCCESS`, and three with the `audio`
//! feature on: [`EGFX_CHANNEL_NAME`], `Microsoft::Windows::RDS::DisplayControl`
//! and `AUDIO_PLAYBACK_DVC`. Every other name is refused with
//! `STATUS_NOT_FOUND`, which MS-RDPEDYC 3.2.5.2 defines as the answer for a
//! channel the client does not implement. Refusing by name is what stops a
//! server opening `rdpdr` or `rdpsnd` and then waiting forever for traffic
//! that will never come; silence would look like a hung client.
//!
//! # Compression
//!
//! `DYNVC_DATA_COMPRESSED` and `DYNVC_DATA_FIRST_COMPRESSED` carry RDP 8.0
//! bulk compressed payloads. PRDRDP/05 §5.2 says RDP 6.1 and is wrong;
//! `docs/RDP_SPEC_NOTES.md` §2.1 records the correction. We do not accept
//! either form, and the reason is a budget rather than a gap: the RDP 8.0
//! decompressor carries a 2.5 MB history window
//! (`rdp_codecs::zgfx::HISTORY`), the graphics channel already owns one, and
//! a second independent history for a form no server uses unless the client
//! asks for it is 2.5 MB spent on nothing. It is refused with a typed error
//! naming the phase rather than with a `todo!()`.
