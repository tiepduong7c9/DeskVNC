//! Virtual channels: the static layer, the registry, and what a handler may
//! produce (MS-RDPBCGR 2.2.6.1, PRDRDP/05 §5.1, PRDRDP/12 §3.11).
//!
//! # Where this sits
//!
//! [`crate::session::run_loop`] owns the socket and the dispatch. It knows
//! two things about this module and nothing else: a Send Data Indication that
//! is not on the I/O channel goes to [`StaticChannels::deliver`], and a
//! clipboard command goes to [`StaticChannels::clipboard_text`]. Adding a
//! channel is a variant of [`Handler`] and a line in
//! [`StaticChannels::new`]; the run loop does not change.
//!
//! # The four layers, and which one is here
//!
//! `rdp_pdu::vc` draws them (`crates/rdp-pdu/src/vc/mod.rs:12`):
//!
//! ```text
//! MCS Send Data Indication on a channel id      <- the run loop unwraps this
//!   -> CHANNEL_PDU_HEADER, 1600 byte chunks     <- this file
//!     -> drdynvc, DATA_FIRST and DATA           <- channels::dvc
//!       -> RDP_SEGMENTED_DATA, RDP 8.0 bulk     <- channels::egfx
//!         -> RDPGFX_HEADER commands             <- channels::egfx
//! ```
//!
//! Every one of those parsers is in `rdp-pdu` and every reassembler is
//! `rdp-pdu`'s. This crate owns the I/O, the state that spans PDUs, and the
//! policy decisions `rdp-pdu` deliberately refuses to make (PRDRDP/13 §2.7).
//!
//! # Zero copy, layer by layer
//!
//! A chunk that carries `CHANNEL_FLAG_FIRST | CHANNEL_FLAG_LAST`, which is
//! every clipboard message under 1600 bytes and most EGFX ones, is returned
//! by [`ChannelReassembler::push`] as a borrow of the receive buffer with no
//! copy at all (`crates/rdp-pdu/src/vc/static_vc.rs:388`). The borrow is
//! carried down through drdynvc and into the codecs, so the first byte that
//! is written anywhere is a decoded pixel (D9).
