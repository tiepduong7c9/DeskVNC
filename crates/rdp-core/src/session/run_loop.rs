//! The connected state pump (PRDRDP/12 §4.4, PRDRDP/06 §2.2).
//!
//! A `tokio::select!` over the framer, the command channel, a one second
//! stats tick and cancellation, with the same two orderings
//! `crates/vnc-core/src/session/run_loop.rs:685` makes and for the same
//! reasons: `biased` so a teardown cannot be starved by a busy server, and
//! the socket polled before the command channel so a burst of input cannot
//! stall the picture.
//!
//! One structural difference from the RFB loop, and it is the only one that
//! is not a copy. **Nothing in this loop touches the socket's write half.**
//! The stream is split before the loop starts, the write half is moved into
//! [`crate::transport::writer`], and the loop holds only an
//! `mpsc::Sender<Outbound>`. [`RunLoop::send`] is a channel send, not a
//! socket write. That is what makes the "no write inside a `select!` arm"
//! rule structural rather than a convention: the operation that is not
//! cancellation safe, a partial `write_all`, does not appear in this loop at
//! all (PRDRDP/00 R10).
//!
//! # Cancellation safety, await by await
//!
//! | Await | Where | Safe because |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `cancel.cancelled()` | select arm | `CancellationToken::cancelled` holds no state |
//! | `self.framer.read()` | select arm | ours; see [`crate::transport::framer`], whose only await is `read_buf` into a buffer the framer owns |
//! | `commands.recv()` | select arm | `mpsc::Receiver::recv` never consumes a message from a dropped future |
//! | `stats_tick.tick()` | select arm | `Interval::tick` with `MissedTickBehavior::Skip`: a dropped tick is simply not observed |
//! | `self.send(..)` | branch body | `mpsc::Sender::send` either delivered the message or did not, never half of one |
//! | `emit(events, ..)` | branch body | the same, and it can block for a long time, which is intended backpressure |
//!
//! Decoding is on this task and does not await, which is what makes the duty
//! cycle figure decode time and nothing else (PRDRDP/04 §10.2).
