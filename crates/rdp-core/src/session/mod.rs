//! The session task: spawn, one attempt, the pump, and what survives a
//! reconnect (PRDRDP/12 §3.13, PRDRDP/06 §2.1).
//!
//! * [`connect`] performs one connection attempt end to end.
//! * [`cookie`] holds the auto reconnect cookie between attempts.
//! * [`redirect`] follows a Server Redirection to the machine it names.
//! * [`run_loop`] is the connected state pump.
//! * [`graphics`] decodes bitmap and pointer updates into events.
//! * [`input`] turns a [`ClientCommand`] into fast path input events.
//! * [`signal`] is the vocabulary the pump matches on.
//! * [`settings`] is the state that survives a reconnect.
//!
//! # Tasks
//!
//! One tokio task per session, spawned by [`RdpSession::spawn`], exactly as
//! `vnc_core::Session::spawn` does at
//! `crates/vnc-core/src/session/mod.rs:46`: create a bounded command channel
//! of 256, create a `CancellationToken`, build the `SessionHandle`, spawn the
//! supervisor, return the handle.
//!
//! Inside one connection attempt there are two, not one. The session task
//! owns the framer and the dispatcher; the writer task owns the write half of
//! the stream and nothing else. Neither needs to be `Sync` and neither sits
//! behind a lock, because the only state they share is the pair of byte
//! counters and the bounded channel between them, which is the whole point of
//! splitting them (PRDRDP/06 §2.1).
