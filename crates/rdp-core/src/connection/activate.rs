//! Phases 6 to 10: Client Info, licensing, capability exchange and connection
//! finalisation (MS-RDPBCGR 2.2.1.11 to 2.2.1.22, PRDRDP/03 §2.7 to §2.11).
//!
//! Everything here travels inside an MCS Send Data Request or Indication on
//! the I/O channel, which is what [`send_data_request`] and [`ServerData`]
//! wrap and unwrap. The bodies are `rdp-pdu`'s; the sequencing is this file's.
//!
//! # Which security header a PDU carries, and how we know
//!
//! MS-RDPBCGR 2.2.8.1.1.2 puts a four byte basic security header on six
//! classes of slow path PDU and on nothing else, and PRDRDP/13 §5.2 tabulates
//! it. `rdp_pdu::rdp::decode_io_pdu` therefore takes the class as a parameter
//! rather than working it out, because it cannot be worked out by looking: the
//! first two bytes of a Share Control PDU are a `totalLength` and the first
//! two bytes of a Client Info PDU are a flag word, and a Demand Active of 128
//! bytes begins with the same two bytes as `SEC_INFO_PKT`.
//!
//! So the class comes from two things we know and the server does not choose:
//!
//! * **The channel.** Connect time auto detect (2.2.14.1.1), the heartbeat
//!   (2.2.16.1) and the Server Initiate Multitransport Request (2.2.15.1) all
//!   arrive on the MCS message channel when one was allocated. Anything on the
//!   message channel therefore has a security header, and its flags word says
//!   which class it is, unambiguously.
//! * **The phase.** On the I/O channel, everything between the Client Info PDU
//!   and the Demand Active is a licensing PDU (2.2.1.12) and carries
//!   `SEC_LICENSE_PKT`; everything from the Demand Active onwards is a Share
//!   Control PDU and carries no header at all. During the licensing phase a
//!   Share Control header is recognised rather than assumed away, by
//!   [`looks_like_share_control`], so a server that skips licensing entirely
//!   and goes straight to the Demand Active is read correctly instead of
//!   losing four bytes to a header that is not there.
//!
//! The phase half of that is the rule FreeRDP's connection state machine
//! applies, and it is the reason `decode_io_pdu` is shaped the way it is.
