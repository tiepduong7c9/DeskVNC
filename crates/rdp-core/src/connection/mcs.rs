//!
//! ```text

//! ConferenceCreateRequest        -> the GCC PER wrapper around them
//! ConnectInitial                 -> the MCS BER envelope around that
//! x224::write_data_tpdu_with     -> the X.224 Data TPDU and the TPKT header
//! ```
//!
//! and the Connect Response comes back the same way in reverse, each step
//! handing the next a borrowed slice of the receive buffer rather than a
//! copy.
