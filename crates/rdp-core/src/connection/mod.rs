//! The connection sequence, X.224 to `Connected`
//! (MS-RDPBCGR 1.3.1.1, PRDRDP/03 §2, PRDRDP/12 §3.9).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Each file is a function taking the framed stream and returning what the
//! next phase needs, so the whole sequence reads top to bottom in
//! [`connect`] below. That is a deliberate choice against the shape a
//! protocol library has to take: a library cannot own the loop, so it exposes
//! a sequence with a `step` method and the caller drives it. We own the loop,
//! so the sequence is straight line `await` code, which is easier to read and
//! to get right (PRDRDP/12 §3.9).
//!
//! [`ConnectStage`] is what survives of PRDRDP/03 §3.2's state list under
//! that choice. It labels the log line and the error rather than driving the
//! loop, which is exactly what PRDRDP/06 §3.2 asks of it: "a plain enum with
//! a `name()` for logging". Where the two documents disagree about the shape
//! they agree about the phases, and the phases are what a reader needs.
//!
//! # Cancellation
//!
//! **This sequence is not cancellation safe, and does not need to be.** A
//! half written Connect Initial is a desynchronised stream, and RDP has no
//! resynchronisation point inside a TPKT unit. It is not inside a `select!`,
//! and the only thing that cancels it is the cancellation token, which drops
//! the whole attempt and the whole stream with it. Nobody should later wrap
//! it in a `select!` without changing the writes first (PRDRDP/12 §5.4).
//!
//! # The phases, and where each lives
//!
//! | Phases | File |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1, the X.224 negotiation | [`negotiate`] |
//! | 2, the TLS upgrade and CredSSP | [`crate::transport`], [`nla`] |
//! | 3 and 4, the Basic Settings Exchange and Channel Connection | [`mcs`] |
//! | 6 to 10, Client Info to the Font Map | [`activate`] |
//!
//! Phase 5, RDP Security Commencement, is skipped by construction: it exists
//! only for standard RDP security, which this client never negotiates
//! (PRDRDP/03 §2.6, D6).
