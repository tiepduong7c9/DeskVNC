//! The error taxonomy, and the stage enum every error is reported against.
//!
//! The variant list is PRDRDP/03 §9.1's, amended by PRDRDP/12 §3.7 (PRDRDP/00
//! R46 settles that there is one definition and that this is it). The file
//! mirrors `crates/vnc-core/src/error.rs` in shape and in contract: variants
//! grouped by comment banner, then `is_transient` (that file, line 105),
//! `needs_user_action` (line 119) and `user_message`, which are the three
//! methods the reconnect supervisor reads.
//!
//! What is here and not in PRDRDP/03's list is [`RdpError::NotImplemented`].
//! Every phase of the connection sequence now has code behind it, so nothing
//! in this crate constructs the variant today; it stays because the rule it
//! exists for has not changed. A session that parses remote bytes may not
//! answer an unwritten phase with a `todo!()`, and the next feature that lands
//! half written (the virtual channels, the surface commands) answers with a
//! typed error naming its [`ConnectStage`] instead, so a log line and a bug
//! report both say which phase to look at.
