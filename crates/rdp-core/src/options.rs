//! Validation and resolution of [`remote_core::RdpOptions`] (PRDRDP/12 §3.6).
//!
//! The definitions live in `remote-core`, because they are serialised into the
//! `hosts.rdp_settings` column and the shell has to build them
//! (PRDRDP/02 §5.4). What is here is the pass that turns a stored blob into
//! something the connect path can use without checking anything again:
//! constructing a [`ResolvedOptions`] is the only way into
//! [`crate::connection`], so a rule added here cannot be bypassed by a new
//! call site.
//!
//! Anything out of range is clamped and recorded as a warning rather than
//! rejected, with two exceptions that are genuinely unusable: a channel name
//! the wire field cannot hold, and a phase 3 feature the profile asked for
//! that this build does not have.
