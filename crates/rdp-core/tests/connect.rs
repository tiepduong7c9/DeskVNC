//! The acceptance test for the lane: drive a session from the first byte on
//! the socket to `Connected`, decode a bitmap, and round trip an input event,
//! over a real TCP socket, against a mock that encodes with the same encoders
//! the client parses with (PRDRDP/12 §8.4).
//!
//! # What this covers and what it cannot
//!
//! The production functions are used unchanged:
//! `connection::negotiate_security` for phase 1, `connection::after_upgrade`
//! for phases 2c to 10, and `RunLoop` for the connected pump. What sits
//! between the first two in a real session is the TLS handshake, and the mock
//! has no certificate to do one with, so the two halves are driven over the
//! same plain socket. That is a real composition rather than a bypass:
//! `connection::connect` calls the same two functions with
//! `transport::upgrade_tls` between them, and the split exists because the
//! handshake needs the whole stream rather than a read half.
//!
//! The missing piece is a committed test key pair
//! (PRDRDP/12 §3.14 `tests/common/certs.rs`), which is what would let the
//! mock stand up a TLS listener and the whole of `connection::connect`, TLS
//! and CredSSP included, run end to end.
