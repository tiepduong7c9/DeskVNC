//! A configurable in-process RDP server for end to end tests
//! (PRDRDP/12 §8.4, PRDRDP/09 §3).
//!
//! It speaks the real wire protocol over a real TCP socket bound to
//! `127.0.0.1:0`, so the client under test exercises `vnc-transport`,
//! `rdp-core`'s framer and its connection sequence exactly as it would
//! against a Windows host. That is the argument
//! `crates/vnc-core/tests/common/mock_server.rs:3` makes for the RFB mock and
//! it holds here: a `DuplexStream` would skip the transport layer and prove
//! less.
//!
//! **The one rule that makes this affordable is in `rdp-pdu`: every PDU type
//! implements both `Decode` and `Encode`.** The mock is a state machine over
//! the same type definitions the client uses, writing where the client reads
//! and reading where the client writes. Its size comes from scenario
//! plumbing, not from wire formats.
//!
//! Everything the client sends is recorded (see [`Recorded`]) so tests can
//! make assertions about what reached the wire, and the mock can be told to
//! misbehave in the specific ways the connection sequence has to survive.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! No TLS and no CredSSP. The mock has no certificate, so it answers the
//! X.224 negotiation with `PROTOCOL_SSL` and the test drives the phases
//! either side of the upgrade separately: `negotiate_security` over the
//! socket, then `after_upgrade` over the same socket. Both are the production
//! functions; what is skipped is the handshake between them, which needs a
//! committed test key pair (PRDRDP/12 §3.14 `tests/common/certs.rs`) that
//! does not exist yet.
//!
//! # What it does after the joins
//!
//! Phases 6 to 10 and then a live session: it reads the Client Info PDU,
//! answers licensing, sends a Demand Active, reads the Confirm Active and the
//! four finalisation PDUs, sends its own four, and then draws one bitmap
//! update on the fast path and reads whatever input comes back. That is what
//! makes `tests/connect.rs` able to assert a decoded pixel and an input event
//! round trip rather than only the shape of the handshake.
