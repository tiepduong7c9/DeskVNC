 *
 * **Unknown keys are kept and re-emitted.** `save_host` carries the blob as
 * an opaque string, so it survives a round trip through a UI that has never
 * heard of it; the *editor* does not, because it parses into a typed object
 * and writes a fresh one. A build predating a field would silently drop it,
 * and the field that makes that bite is `legacyTls`: the host quietly stops
 * being reachable. Keeping the leftovers is one line in the serializer and
 * closes the whole class rather than just that field.
 *
 * Mirrors `vnc_store::RdpSettings`, which flattens `remote_core::RdpOptions`
 * into itself, so the blob is one flat field list rather than two nested
 * ones and the editor reads everything at one level.
