//
// THE close bug (user report: "if I manually disconnect, the close button on
// the dialog does not work").
//
// While a `tauri://close-requested` listener is registered, tauri prevents
// EVERY close, including one this webview asked for itself
// (`tauri/src/manager/window.rs`: `if window.has_js_listener(…) { api.prevent_close() }`).
// The `@tauri-apps/api` wrapper then finishes the job with `window.destroy()`,
// and `capabilities/session.json` grants `core:window:allow-close` but NOT
// `core:window:allow-destroy`, so that last invoke was rejected by the ACL and
// the window simply never went away. Every dismissal path (this button, Escape,
// the OS close button) died the same way, for every session opened from a saved
// host (ad-hoc sessions never registered the listener, so they closed fine).
//
// The fix: drop the hold BEFORE closing. With no JS listener left, a plain
// `close()` is not intercepted, so it runs the shell's `CloseRequested`
// handler, which is what releases the keyboard grab, cancels file transfers
// and shuts the session down. `destroy()` is only a last-resort fallback (and
// the capability now allows it), because it would skip all of that.
