//! Session commands: connect, event forwarding, input, lifecycle.
//!
//! Data paths (PRD/01 §3, §5):
//! - Framebuffer updates and cursor shapes go to the webview **binary** over
//!   the `tauri::ipc::Channel` captured at connect time
//!   (`InvokeResponseBody::Raw`, framing in `crate::framing` /
//!   `src-tauri/FRAME_FORMAT.md`). They go straight through: a credit scheme
//!   tried here in 0.26.0 held frames until the webview acknowledged one and
//!   asked the server for a repaint on overflow, which fed the starvation it
//!   reacted to. Staleness is bounded in the renderer instead, where the work
//!   happens and where shedding cannot ask the server for more.
//! - Everything else goes as small JSON via
//!   `emit_to(window_label, "session://event", …)`.
//! - Input comes back as a raw binary body (`send_input`).
//!
//! SECURITY INVARIANT: stored credentials are loaded in Rust (on a blocking
//! thread) while building `ConnectOptions`, they NEVER pass through JS.
